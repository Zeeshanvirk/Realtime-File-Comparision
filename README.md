# Realtime-File-Comparision
Two excel files data has been compared using JavaScript 
In this Application i have used plain Html and javascript 
First of all you need to upload two files provided above
WHen user clicks UploadsData the files will be loaded from local memory and get converted into Json arrays 
Further on i have used these two arrays and created a resultant json array 
on the basis of difference between file B and file A of column Final Order (Cases)
After comparison the resultant json array is available to be download.
